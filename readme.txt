Address book application

The application has only a backend. I've implemented an address book API for logged users and a Django admin page for administrators or users in which staff status is True.
Django, Django Rest Framework was used to build an application and SQLite for persisting data.
You can run this application using Django dev server. Also, Iâ€™ve prepared a Postman requests collection with which you can test features.


1) Features:

* Django admin CMS:
  - with standard user and groups pages
  - CRUD for address and favorite entries
